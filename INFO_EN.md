# Weather Averages

#### This application averages the forecasts from DarkSky and OpenWeatherMap weather providers not only for your location but also for any location you choose on the map
#### Weather Averages uses a minimum of internet traffic, quickly receives fresh forecasts even on GPRS / EDGE networks, which is ideal for remote locations such as mountains and open water
#### In the absence of Google Play Services, you can still get forecasts - devices supported since Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)
#### Weather Averages is an open-source project, the application does not track your location or collect your personal information
